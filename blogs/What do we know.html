    <div class="blog-content"><h1>What do we know</h1>

<h2>Chore of knowing</h2>

<p>Patience to learn is important. Tasks require their due time. Calmly sitting with a task is how you actually complete it. </p>

<p>I hated school and I hated college due to the way they practiced learning. A learning with a foreboding that you will be caught committing the most heinous crime of all, that is, not being able to write in an exam what you "learnt". </p>

<p>When I say the most heinous crime, I do mean it. I think murder is genuinely considered a morally superior crime than getting bad grades, at least in India. </p>

<p>If a kid with excellent grades were to go out and murder someone there would be an inquisition as to why this kid, this really good kid, who was doing so well in school went out and murdered a person. What torture must this bright child have been put through by some evil company around him to have lead to such an event.</p>

<p>While a kid with bad grades would have seemed so obvious to have committed such a crime as it was his nature. The flaws in this kids character that lead to the murder was already showcased when those same flaws led to all those poor grades.</p>

<p>We all know who commits the actual crime.</p>

<p>While there's a tendency for people to victimize themselves too readily, I think this case is genuine and applies to most people around the world - they are real victims of extremely poor education systems. We should recognize ourselves as such.</p>

<p>To overcome any brutality performed on you, there must be an identification. To relieve yourself of the burden of that brutality, you should first see that a crime has been committed and you were the victim. </p>

<p>You might think school is not "that" bad, but sadly it is. The form of learning practiced in schools has affected me deeply and allowed me a mentally and emotionally less profound life. Probably you too. The most learnable years of my life have been stolen from me and even when I have sort of moved out of the system, from school, then entrance exams, then colleges, wired my brain in a way that when learning I tend to put in an artificial sense of foreboding that I will be committing a crime if I learn something whilst giving it the due time it needs or the due time I need to learn it.</p>

<p>When I sit to read an article about a topic I am eager to understand, I read a paragraph and then this fear takes hold of me, asking why I do not know something that I have just started reading. I tell myself "OK, calm down you haven't even read this paragraph properly you will understand this soon enough. Let's read the first paragraph again". Though at this point I have become too anxious to understand the first paragraph and not understanding it just increases my anxiety. Now the fear shall carry me through multiple sites reading many articles unrelated or sort of related and I have exhausted myself, worked actually hard and learned nothing, so I close all the tabs till I reach back to the first one I opened. I sit and watch it with guilt and broken spirits and think only if I had just read this one through, I would know something.</p>

<p>The knowledge still requires its due and I sit in debt.</p>

<p>It's this sense of inadequacy, of always being behind, that breeds a toxic culture around learning. Desperate to prove ourselves, we twist our perception of knowledge.</p>

<h2>Enter stage right</h2>

<p>Absolute clowns, I find those who make knowledge a dance-off. A bad one at that, trying to see who can bend their leg better. This is something buffoons cultivate in their environment to create a sense of self.</p>

<p>Creating identities around pieces of knowledge is different from creating an identity just knowing more of it. Schools, again, are the primary culprits in fostering this mindset.</p>

<p>This culture has seeped into our daily lives. By the end of my school years, I found myself constantly trying to prove my intelligence to others, eventually convincing myself that I knew "a bit" (I wish I could punch that guy). While such behavior is typical of teenagers, the reverence our society holds for "knowing" is abhorrent when contrasted with its disregard for the process of learning.</p>

<p>It wasn't until a chance encounter during my school years that I began to question this deeply ingrained mindset. The experience served as a stark reminder of the innate curiosity and joy of learning that we so often lose sight of in our pursuit of knowledge for knowledge's sake.</p>

<p>It was some summer holiday, I don't remember which, absolutely drenched in sweat after a 5 over match of cricket. I went to one of the friends' houses I was playing with, and aunty had made some chilled mango shakes. We were extremely eager to have them but she had told us to cool off first or we'd get sick.</p>

<p>Sitting under the fan, waiting for the point where aunty would be satisfied with the amount of cooling off that was needed to not get sick, a little boy probably 9 or 10 (whom I hadn't seen in this house) came rolling out of the kitchen (by rolling I mean rolling). This little creature then opened its mouth and proceeded to shout so loud as if our eardrums were fated to cause the end of the world. A second after I had gathered myself from the near-death experience, the creature still shouting, my mind then assembled the words of the scream as "TOTTER UNDERWATER, TOTTER UNDERWATER" as he moved in weird movements, falling and jumping on the floor. After a few seconds, he realized that a new person was sitting in what I could only think of as his coral reef. The alerted creature approached and looked at me curiously, so I gently asked his name, to which he repelled. Intriguing. So I went for broke: "Do you like octopuses?"</p>

<p>This kid lit up and started rattling off octopus trivia like he was getting paid by the fact. There I was, getting schooled on cephalopods by a squeaky toy. It was awesome. Pure, unfiltered fascination, his and mine.</p>

<p>Mid-way through a particularly animated description, the kid grabbed my hand and I was being dragged down the hallway.</p>

<h2>Exit Stage left</h2>

<p>He took me to his present room. As we entered the room, I was awestruck by a table overflowing with an array of artistic creations. Drawings, writings, and crafts spilled onto the floor, forming a beautiful collage of something as unconstrained as the water all the pieces were trying to depict. I peppered him with questions about the different things he sees in the some understandable, some abstract drawings he has made. One of them depicted a coral mass being the head of a big mushroom, a water-based car with propellers on the back, and a seahorse as its hood ornament.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of exploration, he eagerly poked me to say that he wants to show me something. Entranced, I followed. He retrieved a drawing book from the floor and put it on the table. He opened it to reveal what initially seemed like the calmest, most uninteresting drawings I'd seen yet: a simple horizontal line a quarter of the way from the top, representing the ocean's surface, with a basic boat, probably owned by the stick man that was in it. The remaining three-quarters was just filled with light blue using a crayon, though I appreciated that it was a slightly darker blue as it got lower.</p>

<p>Being polite, I said, "Nice". Then he turned the page to a page that was completely blue and getting darker. He began turning pages, each one progressively darker blue until we reached pages of pure blackness, after which it stopped. At the end of a page of just black was written "Depth of Mariana Trench". He looked at me, explaining that these were the exact colors of the ocean as you descend. The tension of the turning pages had filled my head with blood and it was pounding. I loved it.</p>

<p>I wasn't going to be able to say much when he turned the page again and it was black again, though it seemed he had just mixed a little yellow at the end. If humans could self-implode, I would have there. But then the last page turned to show, at the end of the dark depths lower than the depth of the Mariana Trench, at the bottom of the ocean, a ground lit up by a magnificent lighthouse where a boy on its balcony gazed out into the abyss. It clicked - I am on my old bed upside down going through one of my first transformative experiences reading a book called "Five go to demon's rocks". The characters are trapped in a lighthouse and I am there with them in the dark, searching for something to get out.</p>

<p>I remembered creating countless lighthouses, imagining calls to distant ships, conversing with sailors, devouring books on navigation and lighthouse architecture. Returning to the present, my vision blurring, the ocean soaked. I rubbed my eyes and reflected on how fictional detectives like Poirot or Sherlock Holmes, once vibrant rivers of inspiration, had become stagnant pools—symbols of knowledge I wished to possess rather than lessons to be learned.</p>

<p>That was one the biggest performance I had seen, but one of passion not knowledge.</p>

<h2>A Call to the Sea</h2>

<p>I implore you to do two things:
First, understand that learning is a wondrous journey, not the chore our institutions have conditioned us to believe. Recognize that we are victims of a mentally violent process.
Second to go back home, to the wondrous abstract mental places of young where lived everything, and none could escape the punishment of our imaginations.</p>
